# Entity Library

This is an auto-generated library. Most of the time you don't need to edit the code manually.

**Install the sea orm cli:**

```sh
cargo install sea-orm-cli
```

**To generate / upate entities from a live database:**

```sh
sea generate entity -l --with-serde both --date-time-crate chrono -o entity/src
```
